/** A custom location manager for determining user coordinates
 
 This is a light wrapper around CLLocationManager that adds some caching 
 capabilities and intelligence to the way location results are reported. At a 
 very basic level, HPLocationManager allows different parts of a single app to 
 use the same location requests and get the most accurate data possible without 
 having to wait for too long. It also follows a graceful degradation routine in 
 order to fetch the most accurate location in as little time as possible.
